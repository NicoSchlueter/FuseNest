# Note
This is an early version. Its pretty much the bare minimum. **And things are going to change, including the license. This will always be free for hobbyists but I may decide to sell the commercial version.**
Be aware.

# How to use
* one body per component, holes are currently not supported. 
* Launch from Modify > 2D nest
* Select components
* enter sheet size
* press start nest
* wait until it looks ok-ish
* press "apply nest"
* press ok
* hope it worked

### Whant some options?

There are some cool options, like **spacing!**
open SVGnest/svgnest.js and look at line 28.
Just save, no need to restart.

# Installation
* Download the Project as ZIP and extract it somewhere you can find again, but won't bother you. (or use git to clone it there)
* Open Fusion360 and press ADD-INS > Scripts and Add-ins
* Select the tab Add-Ins and click the green plus symbol next to "My Add-Ins"
* Navigate to the extracted Project forlder and hit open
* The Add-in should now appear in the "My Add-Ins" list. Select it in the list. If desired check the "Run ond Startup" checkbox and hit run.
* The Command will appear as Modify > 2D Nest
